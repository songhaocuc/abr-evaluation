The Waterloo Streaming Quality-of-Experience Database-III consists of 20 RAW HD reference videos and 450 simulated streaming videos, and of an average duration of 13 seconds. In order to generate meaningful and representative test videos, we conducted a set of DASH video streaming experiments, recorded the relevant streaming activities, and reconstructed the streaming session using video processing tools. The streaming sessions generated by 6 adaptive streaming algorithms including rate-based, BBA, AIMD, Elastic, QDASH, and FESTIVE under 13 wide-ranging bandwidth conditions are recorded and evaluated by 34 subjects. Subjects score the quality of each video sequence according to the 0-100 numerical quality scale.

滑铁卢流媒体QoE数据库-III由20个原始HD参考视频和450个模拟流视频组成，平均持续时间为13秒。为了生成有意义和代表性的测试视频，我们进行了一些列DASH视频流实验，记录了相关的流媒体活动，并且用视频处理工具重建了流媒体会话。新的流媒体会话由6个自适应流媒体算法（包括rate-based,BBA,AIMD,Elastic,QDASH,FESTIVE）在13个广泛的带宽条件下生成的，对新的流媒体会话进行记录并由34个测试人员进行评价。测试人员根据0-100的质量分数对每段视频序列的质量进行打分。


The data folder is organized in the following way:
data --
	  |
	  streamInfo (folder)
	  |
	  VQAResults (folder)
	  |
	  representations (folder)
	  |
	  bandwidthProfiles.mat
	  |
	  sourceVideo.mat
	  |
	  actualBitrate.mat
	  |
	  MOS.mat
	  |
	  demo.m
	  |
	  readme.txt


The streamInfo folder stores the necessary streaming events recorded in the streaming experiment. Each row in a streamInfo matrix represents one streaming session. The 5 columns represents frame rate, video quality level (0-indexed from low to high), initial buffering time in number of frames, stalling position (with stalling and initial buffering) in number of frames, and stalling duration in number of frames.

streamInfo文件夹存储了流媒体实验中记录的必要的流事件。streamInfo矩阵中的每一行代表一个流会话。矩阵的5列分别表示帧速率、视频质量等级(0开始从低到高)、初始缓冲时间(帧数)、卡顿位置(卡顿和初始缓冲，帧数为单位)、卡顿持续时间(帧数)。

To facilitate the research in QoE of streaming videos, we also release the objective evaluations on the Waterloo SQoE-III database. The results of objective VQA and QoE algorithms are stored in VQAResults folder.

The representations folder stores the encoding configurations of DASH videos used in the streaming experiment (bitrate ladder).

The bandwidthProfiles matrix stores the 13 bandwidth profiles used in the streaming experiment. Each row of the matrix represents a network profile while each column represents an instantaneous network bandwidth in kbps.

The sourceVideo.mat stores the name of reference videos used in the experiment as well as their frame rates.

The actualBitrate.mat stores the actual encoding bitrate of each video segment.

The MOS.mat stores the mean opinion score (MOS) vector of the 450 streaming videos.

The demo.m demonstrate the sample usage of the dataset such as how to obtain some important statistics of each streaming video.
