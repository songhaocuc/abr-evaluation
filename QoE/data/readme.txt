The Waterloo Streaming Quality-of-Experience Database-III consists of 20 RAW HD reference videos and 450 simulated streaming videos, and of an average duration of 13 seconds. In order to generate meaningful and representative test videos, we conducted a set of DASH video streaming experiments, recorded the relevant streaming activities, and reconstructed the streaming session using video processing tools. The streaming sessions generated by 6 adaptive streaming algorithms including rate-based, BBA, AIMD, Elastic, QDASH, and FESTIVE under 13 wide-ranging bandwidth conditions are recorded and evaluated by 34 subjects. Subjects score the quality of each video sequence according to the 0-100 numerical quality scale.

The data folder is organized in the following way:
data --
	  |
	  streamInfo (folder)
	  |
	  VQAResults (folder)
	  |
	  representations (folder)
	  |
	  bandwidthProfiles.mat
	  |
	  sourceVideo.mat
	  |
	  actualBitrate.mat
	  |
	  MOS.mat
	  |
	  demo.m
	  |
	  readme.txt


The streamInfo folder stores the necessary streaming events recorded in the streaming experiment. Each row in a streamInfo matrix represents one streaming session. The 5 columns represents frame rate, video quality level (0-indexed from low to high), initial buffering time in number of frames, stalling position (with stalling and initial buffering) in number of frames, and stalling duration in number of frames.

To facilitate the research in QoE of streaming videos, we also release the objective evaluations on the Waterloo SQoE-III database. The results of objective VQA and QoE algorithms are stored in VQAResults folder.

The representations folder stores the encoding configurations of DASH videos used in the streaming experiment (bitrate ladder).

The bandwidthProfiles matrix stores the 13 bandwidth profiles used in the streaming experiment. Each row of the matrix represents a network profile while each column represents an instantaneous network bandwidth in kbps.

Te sourceVideo.mat stores the name of reference videos used in the experiment as well as their frame rates.

The actualBitrate.mat stores the actual encoding bitrate of each video segment.

The MOS.mat stores the mean opinion score (MOS) vector of the 450 streaming videos.

The demo.m demonstrate the sample usage of the dataset such as how to obtain some important statistics of each streaming video.
